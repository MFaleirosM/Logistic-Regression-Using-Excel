In these sheets, you can find the parameters for a logistic regression model used to maximize
the log-likelihood function. This aids in understanding how the parameters influence the model 
by controlling probabilities and how to use logistic functions, such as the sigmoid, rectifier, or 
hyperbolic tangent, which introduce non-linearity to the data and give some notion of probability to be applied. 
Additionally, it offers an opportunity to gain familiarity with Excel's Solver tool, often used in operational research and numerical 
calculus, by selecting the appropriate method for finding maxima or minima.
